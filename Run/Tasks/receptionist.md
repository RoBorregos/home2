## Navigation
!! WARNING !!

"Frida_moveit_config" should be running from the manipulation namespace in order for navigation to work.

ZED should be running too.

Run container. From the root directory (home2), run:
```bash
./run.sh navigation --receptionist
```
- Check the RViz window that pops up on the Orin. After a few seconds, you should see the TF and the local costmap moving. If not, restart the Docker container and verify that both the ZED and Frida MoveIt config are running.
- Check the position of the TF in the map. If itâ€™s not correctly positioned, use the "2D Estimate Pose" tool located at the top of RViz. Click on the map where the robot should be, and remember to hold the click and drag to set the orientation angle as well.

## Manipulation

```bash
./run.sh manipulation
